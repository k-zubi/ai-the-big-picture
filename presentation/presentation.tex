            \item They identify and research \alert{electric power}, \alert{chip manufacturing}, \alert{data} and \alert{latency} as key constraints.
            \item Much information is this presentation comes from this report or other reports by Epoch AI\@.

        \frametitle{Scaling: In a Nutshell}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The training compute of frontier AI models continues to grow by 4-5x per year, following a log-linear scaling trend that has persisted for over a decade.
            \item Improving AI performance requires more compute through scaling model size, data quantity, data quality, or architecture efficiency.
            \item Scaling laws reliably predict model loss, but benchmark performance is significantly less predictable.
            \item Epoch AI's analysis identifies electric power, chip manufacturing, data availability, and latency as key constraints that must be overcome to maintain the current scaling trajectory through 2030.

        \frametitle{Will We Run Out Of Human-Made Data for Pre-Training?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The indexed web is estimated to contain roughly 500 trillion tokens of human-generated text and will grow by approximately 50\% by 2030
            \begin{itemize}
                \item About 30 times larger than the largest datasets currently used (about 15 trillion tokens).
                With the current trajectory, we would hit the ``data wall'' in about five years.
            \end{itemize}
            \item It's possible to train several times over the same data (multiple epochs)
            \item Inclusion of other modalities (like images, video and audio), the ``deep web'' (that includes many social media platforms) and private data can further expand the effective data pool
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Converting multimodal content into text-equivalent tokens could roughly triple the available dataset size
            \end{itemize}
            \item The remaining data is likely of lower quality than the data already used
            \item The median projection from Epoch AI is that it's possible to train models with 80,000x the compute of GPT-4 without significant diminishing returns.

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Can We Just Generate More Data?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Using AI to generate training data is increasingly used, particularly for model distillation in post-training, but still unproven at large scale for pre-training data
            \item This brings the risk of producing low-quality data, e.g. with hallucinations or a lack of diversity, potentially resulting in ``model collapse''~\parencite{shumailov2024curserecursiontraininggenerated}
            \item Scaling inference-time compute is a possible way to increase model performance when generating data~\parencite{epoch2023tradingoffcomputeintrainingandinference}, especially now with reasoning models
            \item Using AI-driven verifiers (and non-AI verifiers, e.g. code compilers) to filter generated data by assessed quality is a promising approach given that verification is easier than generation~\parencite{feng2024modelcollapsescalingsynthesized}
            \item Any large-scale application will likely use a sophisticated synthetic data generation pipeline and focus on generating new data out of existing data~\parencite{hao2025magamassivegenreaudiencereformulation}
            \item It's unclear how cost-efficient high-quality synthetic data is

        \frametitle{The Costs of LLMs Are Plummeting}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The cost of an AI model with GPT-4-level quality has dropped by around 75x between Q1 and Q4 2024.~\parencite{artificial_analysis_2024}
            \item This drop is due to a variety of factors including training on more and higher quality data, post-training techniques, distillation, architectural improvements (e.g. increased sparsity through mixture-of-experts), software improvements and potentially price dumping.
            \item An analysis of open-weight models shows that the ``capability density'' of LLMs (based on the total parameter count of models and their results on widely used benchmarks) is currently growing exponentially, doubling approximately every three months.~\parencite{xiao2024densinglawllms}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{What are ``Reasoning Models'' Exactly?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The model ``thinks'' using long chain-of-thought before giving a final answer.
            \item Reinforcement learning (RL) is used on an existing instruction-tuned language model to scale and improve this chain-of-thought ``thinking''.
            \item Each answer is graded by a reward function to steer the model towards longer and more efficient reasoning.
            The reward function could e.g. be an AI model comparing the answer to a sample solution or unit tests for code.~\parencite{kimiteam2025kimik15scalingreinforcement}
            \item Such problem-answer pairs might come from a specialized dataset or be extracted from the web using AI.~\parencite{yeo2025demystifyinglongchainofthoughtreasoning}
            \item Through this training, the model discovers and learns better and longer reasoning chains that result in better answers.
            \item Small-scale domain-specific experiments show that even models as small as 1.5B parameters can develop long chain-of-thought abilities, even on consumer GPUs.~\parencite{tinyzero2025, unsloth_train_2025}

        \frametitle{Benefits of Reasoning Models}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reasoning models outperform non-reasoning models in many tasks, most notably and significantly in reasoning, mathematics and coding.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Top reasoning models are now reaching Olympiad-level performance in competitive coding and competitive mathematics.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Reinforcement learning (RL) seems to generalize significantly better than supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for LLM post-training.~\parencite{chu2025sftmemorizesrlgeneralizes}
            \item Therefore, RL training is likely significantly more data efficient than pre-training, although the details have yet to be properly researched.
            \item This might significantly push the ``data wall'' into the future.
            \item While the model usually ``thinks'' longer for harder and shorter for easier problems automatically, it's also possible to manually steer how long the model ``thinks''.
            \item RL can actually be creative and result in novel solutions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Drawbacks and Limitations of Reasoning Models}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reasoning models generate many more tokens per query than non-reasoning models, requiring \alert{more compute} and resulting in slower response times (up to several minutes) and higher costs.
            \item Reinforcement learning (RL) brings the risk of ``reward hacking'' where the model exploits loopholes in the reward function without achieving the desired behavior.
            \item RL requires problems where answers can be subjectively graded, ideally in a cheap and fully automated way.
            \item It's currently unclear whether significant improvements in agency, creative writing, instruction following, long-context handling, vision, physical world understanding and some other domains can be achieved.

            \item Language model training involves three distinct phases: pre-training, instruction-tuning, and now reinforcement learning (RL) to scale reasoning.
            \item The industry faces a ``data wall'' within five years at current scaling trends.
            \item AI-generated training data is increasingly used but brings risks, making verification of generated content crucial for maintaining quality.
            \item Reasoning models represent a fundamental shift, enabling breakthrough performance in areas where previous models significantly underperformed humans.
            \item These models require more inference compute but may help overcome the looming ``data wall'' since RL training appears more data-efficient than pre-training.
            \item Despite impressive gains in reasoning, planning, math and coding, reasoning models have barely been scaled so far due to them only being discovered recently.
            \item The potential application of RL to agent training could transform AI autonomy, though significant challenges and uncertainties remain.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Imagine a system that can autonomously complete basically any job that a human can perform on a computer.
            \item Let's make a simple calculation to calculate how much such a system might be worth:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Let's very conservatively assume that such an AI could perform work equivalent to 1\% of world GDP (imagine a 1\% increase in global productivity).
                \item Such AI would therefore make around \$1.15 trillion annually (1\% of world GDP).
                \item A tech company with such revenues could be valued at \$6.3 trillion (using current P/S ratio of the NASDAQ 100).
            \end{itemize}
            \item Even using very conservative estimates, it's clear that such AI would be worth an astronomical amount.
            \item Investing trillions of dollars into AI research and development seems worth it once it seems possible that autonomous generalist AI can be achieved.
